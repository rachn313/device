								<!--Image: Conceptual Design Diagram without Labels-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Final_Design.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Our goal is to create a tangible user interface that helps 
									people study and work at home. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In multi-person households, it is difficult to communicate
									or know when others are in a meeting and need space and quiet.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Lumee</b> is a TUI that allows family members or people
									living together in one household to remotely signal to each other that
									they are currently in a virtual meeting. They are also able to designate
									the importance of a meeting, ranging from high priority to low priority.
								</p>
								<p>
									No more memorizing other people's schedules or accidentally zoom
									bombing in the background. Lumee's got your back!

								<p>
									Users communicate with each other via lit and unlit LEDs.
									Ultimately we imagined each user of a household to have
									their own Lumee device, a small box with strips of LEDs on top.
									One strip would be a row of three LEDs and each strip is a
									different color. Each user would be assigned to a different strip, and
									by extension a different color.

								<!--Image: A diagram of the the final LuMee (Design Artifact?)-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Final_Design_And_Diagram.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									On the side of each device are three buttons. If the user presses the 
									first button, the first LED in their assigned strip will light up on each 
									Lumee device. One lit lED indicates that this user is in a low-priority meeting. 
									If the user presses the second button, the second LED will light up on each device. 
									Two lit LEDS indicate that this user is in a medium-priority meeting.
									If the user presses the third button, the third LED will light up on each device. 
									Three lit LEDs indicate that this user is in a high-priority meeting.

								<h2 class="major">Design Process</h2>
								<!--Image: LF Prototype to last Design Diagram-->
								<h3><b>Initial Design</b></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Process_Summary.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<b>
									   Intially we imagined that the LEDs could be controlled with an on/off button
									   and a slider to adjust light intensity. Below, we outline a few initial artifacts
									   that helped us communicate our initial design: user scenario, storyboard, visual and
									   tangible design, and a low-fidelity prototype.
									 </b>
								</p>
								<br>
								<!--User Scenario-->
								<!--Image: Family Picture-->
								<h3><b>Initial User Scenario</b></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/LuMee_Family.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									"The Smith family has two parents working from home (the father is a business consultant, 
									and the mother is a middle school teacher), a child in high school (in a hybrid learning 
									environment), a child in college (located in different timezone) studying remotely from home,
									and a child who is in elementary school."
									<br>
									"Each of the five family members are constantly attending meetings or classes at various times
									of the day, and often find themselves struggling to find privacy, or being able to communicate 
									to one another that they should not be interrupted. Mrs. Smith teaches classes all day and is 
									frequently interrupted by her husband and children, asking for food, playtime, or other things. 
									At 9:00 PM, one of her students located in a different time zone requests an impromptu 1:1 meeting. 
									This is a problematic time for Mrs. Smith, because this is when she usually puts her youngest to bed 
									and checks on her other children. Mrs. Smith has just finished  a meeting with another student, so 
									she does not have time to run through the house between the meetings to let her husband know that he 
									will have to take over.""
								</p>
								<br>
								<!--Storyboard-->
								<!--Image: Storyboard-->
								<h3><b>Initial Storyboard</b></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Storyboard.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									One of the most crucial features of the system is the capability of the LEDs to turn on and off 
									on each device in the household. This network of connected devices and the dynamic LEDs allow for 
									understandable and correct communication between users. If one user is assigned to the red LED, 
									and they turn their LED on, the red LED on every other user’s device should turn on. If the red 
									user adjusts their LED, then the brightness of the every red LED on all of the devices should be 
									adjusted accordingly. The simple and rapid on and off switch on a light captures the nature of the 
									modern workplace: fast-paced and ever-changing, making it the perfect representation for a state of work. 
									Additionally, the portable size and connected network allows each user to have their device in constant 
									proximity to them, wherever they may be.
								</p>
								<br>
								<!--Visual and Tangible Design-->
								<!--Image: Rachel's Initial Images-->
								<h3><b>Initial Visual and Tangible Design</b></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Visual_Tangible_Design.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									We purposefully designed simple features for this device, to ensure that users would intuitively
									understand how to correctly use the device to their advantage. We envisioned a box with a cluster 
									of LEDs on its top. Each LED would represent a different user, so each user could be assigned and  
									identifiable with a unique color. Two buttons and a slider, located on the side of the box, could 
									be used to turn the device on, to turn the user’s LED on, and to adjust the intensity of the light, 
									respectively. In order to allow for a clean design, the electronic equipment, such as the motherboard 
									and battery pack, would be hidden inside the box. In addition to focusing on a simple design, we also 
									wanted the entire device to be comfortable on a flat surface, so that it could be stored near the user 
									in their workspace, likely on a desk or table.
								</p>
								<br>
								<!--Low-Fidelity Prototype-->
								<!--Image: Lily's Prototype-->
								<h3><b>Initial Low-Fidelity Prototype</b></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Low_Fidelity_Prototype.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This low-fidelity prototype was constructed using paper, tape, pipe cleaners, beads, sequins, and 
									mini pom-poms. Ultimately, this prototype captures not only the look and feel of our device, but 
									also provides a limited simulation of potential user interaction: using the slider. If this were a 
									high-fidelity prototype, the slider would adjust the intensity of a specific LED. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<!--Final Design-->
								<!--Image: Final Conceptual Design-->
								<h3><b>Final Design</b></h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Final_Design_And_Diagram.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Although these initial artifacts outline an intensity-based light communication system,
										we ultimately scratched that idea. After recieving feedback from our classmates, we realized
										that our design could have more user-friendly attributes. 
										<br>
										We made three changes to the initial design: accumulation (three LEDS instead of one), buttons
										to control each LED, and less users per device.

								<!--Final Functional Prototype-->
								<!--Image: Final Prototype-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Final_Functional_Prototype_Diagram.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<!--Video: Final Prototype Video-->

								<p>
									This is our final functional prototype, which looks a little different from our
									final conceptual design. We found that in order to implement functional
									prototype using the technological materials available to us, we needed 
									to adjust our final aesthetic design. The lights located next to the set of
									buttons are the LEDs assigned to the device owner. The lights perpendicular
									of those are LEDs assigned to other users.

								<h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
								<!--Image: Rachel's Circuit Sketch-->
								<span class = "image main"><img src = "images/Final_Circuit_Diagram.jpg" alt=""></span>
								<!--Video: My Alligator Clip Video-->
								<span class="image main"><video style = "display:block;margin:0 auto" width = "300" controls><source src = "images/Final_Circuit_Demo.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></video></span>
								<p>
									The technical implementation of our functional prototype consists of two
									components: hardware and software. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The majority of our hardware was chosen in order to work with the motherboard
									we were using, an Adafruit Flora. We used Adafruit Neopixels, which are programmable
									LEDs, Adafruit On/Off Buttons, and conductive thread to create the final circuit.
									We ultimately designed two circuits, one for the LEDs dedicated to the device owner,
									and one dedicated to another user. The owner's LEDs are constructed with three separate 
									series circuits each consisting of a Neopixel and an On/Off Button, connected to PIN 6 on
									the Adafruit Flora. The other user's set of three LEDs are connect in a parallel circuit.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our software consisted of a sketch written in the Arduino IDE, which programs the set of LEDs 
									to turn on and off accordingly. We used a compatable Adafruit Library to write much of our language.
									To see our full code, visit our Github Repository, linked on the main page.

								<h3>Previous Prototypes</h3>
								<!--Previous Prototypes -- Parallel Circuits-->
								<!--Image: Prototype with Parallel Circuit(s)-->
								<span class = "image main"><img src = "images/Prototype_Circuit.jpg" alt=""></span>
								<p>
									Although for the final product, we used three series circuits to construct the device owner's LEDs and
									on/off buttons, we explored a parallel circuit at first. We initially had hoped to build out a parallel
									circuit for both rows of LEDs, but continued to run into problems. Eventually, we figured out that the
									metallic thread was too unstable to support such a complex parallel circuit, so we redesigned our circuitry
									into a set of three series circuits.
